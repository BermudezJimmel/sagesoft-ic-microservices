# AWS API Gateway Service vs Custom API Gateway App
## Technical Comparison & Recommendation

---

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

This document compares two approaches for the API Gateway layer in our Employee Portal architecture:
1. **AWS API Gateway Service** (Fully managed AWS service)
2. **Custom API Gateway App** (Current in-house application on ECS Fargate)

**Recommendation**: Keep the existing Custom API Gateway App with Internal ALB integration for optimal results.

## 📊 **Architecture Comparison**

### **Option 1: AWS API Gateway Service**
```
Employee Portal (Amplify) → AWS API Gateway → Internal ALB → Backend Services
                            (Managed Service)              (EMP, CORE, AUTH, FILES)
```

### **Option 2: Custom API Gateway App (Current)**
```
Employee Portal (Amplify) → Custom API Gateway → Internal ALB → Backend Services
                            (ECS Fargate)                    (EMP, CORE, AUTH, FILES)
```

## 🔧 **AWS API Gateway Service - Technical Overview**

### **What is AWS API Gateway?**
AWS API Gateway is a fully managed service that acts as a "front door" for applications to access backend services, data, or functionality from AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, or other AWS services.

### **Key Features**
```
Core Capabilities:
├── RESTful API creation and management
├── Request/response transformation
├── Authentication and authorization
├── Rate limiting and throttling
├── Request validation and caching
├── Monitoring and logging
├── CORS handling
└── Auto-scaling and high availability
```

### **How It Works**
```
Request Flow:
1. Client Request → API Gateway
2. Authentication & Validation → Built-in security checks
3. Request Transformation → Modify headers/body if needed
4. Backend Integration → Route to appropriate service
5. Response Processing → Transform response if needed
6. Client Response → Return processed response
```

### **Integration Types**
```
API Gateway can connect to:
├── HTTP/HTTPS endpoints (Your ECS services)
├── AWS Lambda functions
├── AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SNS, etc.)
├── Mock responses (for testing)
└── VPC Links (private VPC resources)
```

## 💰 **Cost Analysis**

### **AWS API Gateway Service Costs**
```
Pricing Model: Pay-per-request
├── REST API Requests: $3.50 per million requests
├── Data Transfer Out: $0.09 per GB

└── No infrastructure costs

Monthly Example (100K requests):
├── API Requests: $0.35
├── Data Transfer: ~$5
├── Infrastructure: $0
└── Total: ~$5-10/month
```

### **Custom API Gateway App Costs (Current)**
```

## 🏗️ **Implementation Examples**

### **AWS API Gateway Setup**

#### **1. Create REST API**
```bash
aws apigateway create-rest-api \
  --name "employee-portal-api" \
  --description "Employee Portal API Gateway"
```

#### **2. Create Resources (URL Paths)**
```bash
# Create /auth resource
aws apigateway create-resource \
  --rest-api-id {api-id} \
  --parent-id {root-resource-id} \
  --path-part "auth"

# Create /employee resource
aws apigateway create-resource \
  --rest-api-id {api-id} \
  --parent-id {root-resource-id} \
  --path-part "employee"
```

#### **3. Configure Integration with Internal ALB**
```bash
# Connect to backend services via Internal ALB
aws apigateway put-integration \
  --rest-api-id {api-id} \
  --resource-id {auth-resource-id} \
  --http-method POST \
  --type HTTP \
  --integration-http-method POST \
  --uri "http://internal-alb-123.elb.amazonaws.com" \
  --request-parameters '{"integration.request.header.Host":"method.request.header.X-Service-Name"}'
```

### **Custom API Gateway App (Current Approach)**

#### **Host Header Routing Logic**
```python
def route_request(service_name, request_data):
    # Get Internal ALB endpoint
    alb_endpoint = "internal-alb-123.elb.amazonaws.com"
    
    # Map service to host header
    host_mapping = {
        'EMP': 'emp.internal',
        'CORE': 'core.internal', 
        'AUTH': 'auth.internal',
        'FILES': 'files.internal'
    }
    
    # Add host header for ALB routing
    headers = {
        'Host': host_mapping[service_name],
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': request.headers.get('Authorization')
    }
    
    # Forward request to Internal ALB
    response = requests.post(
        f"http://{alb_endpoint}{request.path}", 
        data=request_data,
        headers=headers
    )
    
    return response
```
