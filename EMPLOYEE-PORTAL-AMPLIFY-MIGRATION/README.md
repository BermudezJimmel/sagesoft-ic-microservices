## 🏗️ **Project Overview**

### **Current Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Employee Portal (AngularJS) on ECS Fargate
- **Backend**: API Gateway + Microservices (EMP, CORE, AUTH, FILES) on ECS Fargate
- **Infrastructure**: Public ALB + Internal ALB setup

### **Target Architecture** 
- **Frontend**: Employee Portal (AngularJS) on AWS Amplify (S3 + CloudFront)
- **Backend**: Existing API Gateway + Microservices (unchanged)
- **Infrastructure**: Remove Public ALB, keep Internal ALB

### **Key Benefits**
- **Cost Reduction**: ~60% savings on frontend infrastructure
- **Performance**: Global CDN distribution via CloudFront
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling for frontend
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployments from GitLab

## 🎯 **Client Value Proposition**

### **Cost Savings**
```
Current Monthly Cost:
├── Public ALB: ~$20
├── ECS Fargate (UI): ~$30
└── Total Frontend: ~$50/month

New Monthly Cost:
├── Amplify Hosting: ~$5
├── CloudFront: ~$5
└── Total Frontend: ~$10/month

Monthly Savings: ~$40 (80% reduction)
```

### **Performance Improvements**
- **Global CDN**: Faster loading worldwide
- **Auto-scaling**: Handle traffic spikes automatically
- **Zero downtime**: Seamless deployments

### **Operational Benefits**
- **Reduced complexity**: No server management for frontend
- **Automated CI/CD**: Faster development cycles
- **Better security**: AWS managed infrastructure

---

## 📊 **Technical Integration**

### **Preserved Components**
- ✅ **API Gateway**: No changes required
- ✅ **Backend Services**: EMP, CORE, AUTH, FILES unchanged
- ✅ **Database**: Existing endpoints remain valid
- ✅ **Internal ALB**: Multi-port setup preserved

### **New Components**
- 🆕 **S3 Bucket**: Static website hosting
- 🆕 **CloudFront**: Global CDN distribution
- 🆕 **Amplify**: CI/CD pipeline from GitLab

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Review Documentation**: Complete-Architecture-Flow.md + amplify-migration-flow.md
2. **Client Approval**: Present migration strategy and benefits
3. **Implementation Planning**: Detailed timeline and resource allocation
4. **Pilot Deployment**: Test environment setup and validation
